## Overview
This repository presents educational implementations of regression algorithms. Each Jupyter Notebook walks through theory, code examples, and visual insights—ideal for learners, educators, or data science enthusiasts aiming to understand regression models.

## Notebooks Included
1. **Simple Linear Regression.ipynb**  
   Introduction to modeling a single predictor and target variable with linear regression.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb**  
   Extends linear modeling to multiple features to capture multidimensional relationships.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression – Economics Dataset.ipynb**  
   Applies multiple linear regression techniques to a real-world economics dataset. (Includes dataset specifics and context.)

4. **Polynomial Regression Implementation.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates how polynomial features can be used within regression to model non-linear patterns.

5. **Logistic Regression Implementation.ipynb**  
   Covers regression for classification tasks, interpreting probabilities, decision boundaries, and evaluation metrics.

6. **Ridge, Lasso Regression.ipynb**  
   Explores regularization methods to improve model generalization—discussing both Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) penalties.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Regression-Models.git
   cd Regression-Models
2. Install dependencies (assuming usage of a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
(If no requirements.txt exists yet, consider adding one with key packages such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
Navigate through each notebook and execute cells to explore the regression workflows.

## Requirements

-Python 3.x
-Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib (add others as needed)

 You can install them via:
 ```bash
 pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Suggestions include:

- Adding new regression techniques (e.g., Elastic Net, Decision Tree Regression)
- Enhancing datasets or adding novel examples
- Improving documentation, visuals, or explanations
- Simply fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
